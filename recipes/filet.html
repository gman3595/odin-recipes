    <h1>Filet</h1>

    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

        <p>There are plenty of ways to cook filet mignon but this recipe is by far my favorite method. If you go out to a nice steakhouse then this is most likely the method they are using to cook your filet. High heat and real butter.</p>

        <p>The secret to cooking the perfect filet mignon is to combine pan searing with an oven finish. Why is this the best way to cook filet mignon? This method gives your filet a slightly crusted outside with a perfectly juicy and tender inside that’s evenly cooked throughout. A cast iron skillet allows you to easily transfer your steak from the oven to stove, making this a really easy filet mignon recipe to master.</p>

        <p>I’ve tried cooking filet mignon strictly on the stovetop for 6-7 minutes per side, but I feel like it tends to overcook the steak and sometimes burns the outside of your filet. The oven is better at providing indirect heat while searing gives you the much desired, grilled and slightly charred edge.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>10 oz. filet</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. butter</li>
            <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tsp chopped rosemary</li>
            <li>1 tsp fresh tarragon</li>
            <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 stick of butter</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Soften butter in microwave safe bowl, 10-15 seconds. Stir in herbs and garlic until fully mixed. Spoon butter onto tin foil doing your best to reshape it to resemble a stick of butter. Place in fridge for ~10 minutes and remove 5 minutes before adding to filet.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 415 degrees fahrenheit. Remove steak from fridge 30 mins before cooking to bring steak to room temperature. Season both sides generously with salt & pepper</li>
            <li>Add plain butter to cast iron skillet and turn heat to high. Place filets face down and sear undisturbed for 2 mins. Flip filets and sear for another 2 mins.</li>
            <li>Transfer skillet directly to the oven. For rare, bake for 4 mins. Medium rare, 5-6 mins. Medium, 6-7 mins. Medium 8-9 mins.</li>
